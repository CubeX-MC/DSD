# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-25

Simplification and scope focus:
- Moved `rules/` into `knowledge/rules/`; updated README links
- Removed plugin and pattern knowledge; knowledge now only houses theorems (rules)
- Rewrote `knowledge/README.md` to reflect minimal scope
- Replaced four-step prompts with two minimal templates: Loop Prompt and Validate Prompt
- Updated `QUICKSTART.md` and `tools/README.md` to match simplified workflow

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-25
- Major framework upgrade (six axioms, execution-actor classification S/M/P/H, validation prompt)
